     <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Melon bread, or ‘melon pan’, is a type of Japanese sweet bread. It’s super yummy but has no melon flavour, it’s just named for its appearance!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Bread Dough</h3>
        <li>300 g baker’s flour</li>
        <li>40 g butter chopped</li>
        <li>25 g sugar</li>
        <li>4 g salt</li>
        <li>160 ml milk</li>
        <li>1 extra large egg</li>
        <li>3 g dry yeast</li>
        
        <h3>Cookie Dough</h3>
        <li>240 g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>80 g butter</li>
        <li>80 g sugar</li>
        <li>1 extra large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Vanilla essence</li>
        <li>Granule sugar for sprinkle</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the cookie dough by placing the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat until light and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and vanilla essence and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Fold through the flour and baking powder.</li>
        <li>Divide the cookie dough into 8 small balls and set aside in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Combine egg, yeast, milk and sugar in a small bowl or jug</li>
        <li>Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre of the flour and add the liquid mixture and stir to form a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Transfer to an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook and knead for about 10 min or until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>With the mixer motor running, add the chopped butter until the butter is combined and a smooth and silky dough forms (about a further 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover and set aside in a warm place to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Divide the bread dough into 8 equal sized balls and knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth.</li>
        <li>Roll out the refrigerated cookie dough on cling wrap to 5mm thick.</li>
        <li>Once it is rolled place one bread dough on top of one cookie dough ball and wrap together using cling wrap.</li>
        <li>Take the cling wrap off and score the cookie dough surface diagonally and sprinkle the granule sugar.</li>
        <li>Repeat for all 8 bread rolls.</li>
        <li>Place them on a cooking paper lined oven tray and cover with clean damp cloth and set aside for about 40 min or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180 degree(356 f) and bake for 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
